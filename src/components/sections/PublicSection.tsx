          my professional life has been defined by the pursuit of excellence across borders. My

          in Fine Arts at <strong className="text-black font-semibold">Howard University</strong>{" "}
          and my father was working in the city; at only six months old, I was taken back to Iraq

          Driven by a <strong className="text-black font-semibold">hope larger than my fear</strong>,

          for $100 a month while painting and selling my artwork to sustain my journey. Upon arriving
